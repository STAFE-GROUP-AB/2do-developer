4. **Orchestrated workflows**: `@orchestrator` for complex tasks

## Examples

```bash
# Direct agent usage
@python-pro optimize this async function
@frontend-specialist create React dashboard
@devops-engineer setup CI/CD pipeline

# Orchestrated workflow
@orchestrator build complete e-commerce platform
```
